         <div class="answer-1">My father is an Indian Government official, so we move around the country or out of it every few years, so Iâ€™ve changed around 14 schools growing up till I graduated. Weâ€™d fly or travel by train to move around, my obsession with creating started with my obsession with aircrafts and drawing them. 

         <p> I drew aircrafts and trains and scenery I saw from them.<p>

        <p>Later on when I was in my teens, I didnâ€™t have a lot of friends for a while, so iâ€™d draw in my class and in my home Iâ€™d learn how to use the computer to digitize my artworks.<p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s kind of how I ended up at art school!<p>
